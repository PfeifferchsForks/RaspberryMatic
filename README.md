___
RaspberryMatic is a free and non-commercial open-source operating system alternative for running a cloud-free smart-home IoT central to provide connectivity to the [homematicIP](https://www.homematic-ip.com/) / [HomeMatic](http://homematic.com/) hardware line of IoT devices developed by [eQ-3](https://eq-3.de) and distributed by [ELV](https://elv.de/). RaspberryMatic has the aim to be 100% compatible to the vendor-developed _HomeMatic CCU3 control central_ (CCU3) system. It can be directly installed on a _[CCU3](https://www.homematic-ip.com/en/products/detail/smart-home-central-control-unit-ccu3.html)_ or _[ELV Charly](https://www.elv.de/elv-smart-home-zentrale-charly-starter-set-bausatz.html)_ hardware device. Alternatively, it can also be installed on a wide range of freely available single-board-computers (SBC) like a [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [ASUS Tinkerboard](https://www.asus.com/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board-S/), [Hardkernel ODROID](https://www.hardkernel.com/product-category/odroid-board/) or even on full-fledged hardware platforms like an [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html) system. Furthermore, it can be run as a virtual appliance in modern virtualization environments (e.g. Proxmox VE, VirtualBox, Synology VMM, Docker/OCI, Kubernetes/K8s, vmWare ESXi, etc.) or even as a pure [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Add-On. On top of that wider range of supported operating environments, it also comes with exclusive features on different levels (WebUI, Linux OS, connectivity, etc.) to support end users with a more modern and advanced user experience compared to the vendor-provided CCU3 operating system.

## :cookie: Features

Due to the used base components, RaspberryMatic is 100% compatibile to the standard CCU control center distributed by eQ3/ELV (CCU2/CCU3). This means, that not only it can use the same HomeMatic/homematicIP IoT hardware like a CCU3 central with the same base version. It also provides the same level of functionality in areas like the WebUI or Add-on compatibility. Furthermore, even system backups are compatible between the two CCU variants, which allows to easily switch between the vendor-provided CCU firmware and this free open-source based CCU system software.

On top of that, RaspberryMatic provides a whole bunch of enhancements or even bugfixes in the WebUI or underlying Linux operating system which are either not _yet_ integrated in the official eQ3 CCU firmware or will never be integrated due to the functionality not being commercially interesting enough for eQ3/ELV.

## :cloud: Quick-Start

Under [Releases](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases) you will find dedicated images/files for each supported target hardware. Such an image is e.g. available as an `RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip` download file. After having unarchived this file you should identify a `*.img` file which can be "flashed" to an adequate target media (sd card, usb-stick, ssd or virtual disk, etc.) using e.g. an imaging tool like [Etcher](https://etcher.io). After having flashed this image on the target media you can then put it into your SBC or CCU3 hardware and boot the system. Depending on the used hardware, RaspberryMatic should then boot-up and try to identify the used HomeMatic/homematicIP RF-Module hardware potentially installed on the GPIO bus of your SBC. If this boot-up is finished, you should be able to access the standard WebUI in your local network by using the address `http://homematic-raspi/` in your web browser. Afterwards you should then find yourself in then normal CCU WebUI where you can start configuring/using your HomeMatic/homematicIP IoT hardware.
